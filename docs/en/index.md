# About LPSub Fonts

[Google Fonts](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started) has the Noto series, as well as a bunch of webfonts such as Ubuntu that can be called, but the rendering effect of the Notorious Sans series in the browser is not as good as Sarasa Gothic, so there is this project.
